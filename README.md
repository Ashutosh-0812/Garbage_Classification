# Garbage Classification 🚮

Welcome to the **Garbage Classification** project!  
This repository provides an intelligent solution for classifying waste using machine learning, making it easier to sort recyclables, organics, and other types of garbage. The project leverages Jupyter Notebooks and Python to build, train, and deploy a robust garbage classifier.

## 🌟 Features

- **Image-Based Classification**: Detect and categorize garbage from images.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using state-of-the-art algorithms for high accuracy.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**: Explore the dataset, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Deployment Ready**: Try the live model using our deployed web application.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. **Upload an image** of waste.
2. The model predicts the category: recyclable, organic, hazardous, or other.
3. Get instant feedback and tips for proper disposal.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook** (99.9%)
- **Python** (0.1%)
- Machine Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Streamlit/Flask (for deployment)
